    <h1>Cookie Example</h1>
    <p>
      This node server demonstrates the use of cookies.
      Cookies are a string of key/value pairs passed between
      the client and server with every request.
      Currently, this site's cookies are:
    </p>
    <ul id="cookie-list">
    </ul>

    <h2>Manipulating Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      You can <a href="/reset">reset</a> the count value
      by setting it in the server (look at the server's
      requestHander() function to see the code responsible).
    </p>
    <p>
      Simiarly, you can <a href="/increment">increment</a>
      or <a href="/decrement">decrement</a> the count value
      by parsing it and modifying it on the server
    </p>

    <p>
      Cookies can be manipulated via JavaScript - the cookies
      listed above are extrated using JavaScript.  However, if
      a cookie has the HTTPOnly flag, it won't be visible to
      JavaScript, as you can try by visiting
      <a href="/secret">secret</a>.  The cookie contains
      'message=shhh', but it isn't on the list above. However,
      you can see it with the web tools (right-click, inspect,
      and view the headers under the network tab).
    </p>

    <p>
      One other important flag is the session flag - cookies marked
      as session cookies are discarded once the browser closes.
    </p>
